Kernel System Calls
-------------------
the first chunk of code is mostly system calls to open libraries and map necessary data,
From what I can tell within the commands -
the command fstat is trying to get file information from the folder WelcometoDevopsTheHardWay,
But it doesn't exist, afterwords the script creates the directory with mkdir,
After it runs an openat command to open at the correct directory (our repo folder)
And then it runs fstat again to get the file information, and then it writes into a file called
GoodLuck - writes text into the file - "there you go tell me what I do"


Broken Symlink
-------------------
The symlink is broken because it was moved to another folder, first you need to delete the old
symlink file, then create a new symlink file that directs to the /backups folder where the actual
file is.



Binary Numbers
--------------

1. 111 = 7
   100 = 4
   10110 = 22
2. 0-255
3. the left most digit represents the sign (positive/negative), 0 = positive, 1 = negative.
   The rest of the 8 bits are the actual number.
4. First we need to break down how we convert every digit. at first the sign is either 0 or 1,
   To represent if it's positive or negative.
   After that we need to convert the exponent (integer) to binary, then we need to convert
   the number after the decimal point to binary. and that's the result
   For example: converting 15.7 to binary: 1111.1011


  4. File System Manipulation
  ------------------------------
  Created the scripts saw that there was some foul play there, a broken link created and a folder that is needed that wasn't created at launch.
  Copied the contents of my fix to the yoursolution.sh script file.
  Tested it and it works.
